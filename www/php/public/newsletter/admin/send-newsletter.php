    /*
     * The problem with the email function is that email hosting providers have quite sophisticated spam detection methods.
     * Even if we just include a single url to this very website, it gets marked as spam and potentially malicious.
     * A proper mailing library could help (e.g. PHPMailer), but introduces a whole lot more complexity for a feature 
     * that was intended to be as simple as possible.
     * 
     * The original intended process was to type in your email adress and then confirm your email as real by clicking 
     * on the validation URL. This link includes the secret from the database, ensuring that only the email owner can 
     * subscribe and unsubscribe from the mailing list. Tho the spam detection of Gmail seemed to particularly dislike 
     * an email coming from a random source, including an URL with multiple query parameters.
     * 
     * To be honest, this is the last nail in the coffin for the newsletter feature.
     * It is bad enough to actually store the email addresses of random people in terms of data security.
     * If there's a breach in the database or if I do not configure the environment correctly, there is a data leak.
     * Also I would need to include some type of data privacy policy and be legally viable for safety and deletion.
     * Moreover in the world of furries, people are reluctant to share their private email addresses (very sensible).
     * 
     * The thing is, this email sending capability of PHP is still useful to notify myself of events on the website.
     * I have worked on a comment drawing feature, similar to MiiVerse on Wii U back then.
     * With that project I have to problem that a submitted comments should always be reviewed for indecent content.
     * One solution would be a submission feature where I need to sign off each common individually to be safe.
     * Oh I just had the idea of reviewing each comment manually, and listing them all.
     * If they have not been reviewed yet, the user has to explicitly click a button for them to appear from a spoiler.
