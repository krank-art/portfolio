## Instructions

### Chocolate cream

* Break up the chocolate and heat in a pan with the cream, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate has completely melted (it should not be boiling).
* Add the sugar and baking cocoa, stir with a whisk until the baking cocoa has dissolved. 
* Fill the bottom of a coffee cup with water and dissolve the soluble coffee in it. 
* Add to the hot cream. 
* The chocolate cream should now rest in the fridge for a few hours. 
* It is best to leave the chocolate cream to cool overnight (12 hours) in the fridge.


### Sponge base

* For the base, separate the egg whites from the egg yolks. 
* Beat the egg whites for 10 minutes, slowly adding the vanilla sugar and sugar.
* The mixture should be creamy and smooth. 

> * In the meantime, preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F) top/bottom heat.
> * Line a 17cm (7") springform tin with baking paper (cut out the appropriate size from the baking paper). 
> * Do not grease the springform pan, otherwise the sponge base will not hold up when rising.

* When the mixture has been beaten, stir in the egg yolk. 
* Sift the flour, baking powder, baking cocoa and starch into the mixture. 
* Stir carefully and pour the batter into the tin.
* Bake the base in the oven for approx. 30 minutes. 
* After baking, put the sponge base in the springform pan onto a cake cooler.
* Carefully cut through the fringe with a butter knife, so the cake doesn't rip when you remove the springform pan.
* Remove the sponge base directly from the springform pan.
* Carefully flip over and remove baking paper.
* Let the sponge base cool for 30-60 min.
* Then cut into 4 slices (for a flat sponge base, only cut 3 slices).


### Putting it together

* Take the chocolate cream out of the fridge.
* Whip the chocolate cream at high speed (60-90sec, the cream should be stiff and no longer runny).
* Spread a layer of chocolate cream on the first base. 
* Place the second cake layer on top and also spread with the chocolate cream. 
* If there are 4 bases in total, spread the third base with chocolate cream as well. 
* Finish with the "lid" and cover the outside of the cake with the remaining chocolate cream (2/3 for the filling, 1/3 to cover the outside). 
* There is usually enough cream left over to decorate the cake with. 
* You can spread some chocolate sprinkles on top.
* You can use a decorating syringe to make some nice cream topping.

The cake is really very simple and ideal for the little gourmets among us who don't like fruit, nuts or anything else in their chocolate cake.
