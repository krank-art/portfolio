# Branding

> **Krank,** created 15th April 2022

* Name of project is very important
* The name should be 
  * short
  * recognizable
  * easy to write
  * communicate what kinda game
  * be similar to other names in the genre
* My current idea is to call it **"Furcraft" (Fur + Craft)**
  * Reasoning
    1. This is a callback to the "WarCraft" Series. (the RTS Warcraft III is a big inspiration for this project)
    2. The two parts and the name communicate the intention:
       * Fur = Furries, Scalies, peoples who like cartoon animal are target group
       * Craft = Artistic skill, or skill in an activity that requires manual dexterity; the game should revolve around creating custom RTS content
    3. Bonus: You can make the acronym FUC with "FurCraft". Now all you need is an extension to that name, like "FurCraft: Karnage".


## Trademark

* I checked the following domains on https://www.hetzner.com/whois
* The domain `furcraft.com` is already reserved by eNom, LLC
  * https://www.whois.com/whois/furcraft.com
  * The initial bidding offer is **3.388$** for that domain.
* There also is a Minecraft server called "FurCraft" (`furcraft.eu`).
* the next best domain would be `furcraft.game`.
  * For some reason, `.game` domains are super expensive (599€ / year).
* I should make some research, if "FurCraft" is a registered name yet.
  * as far as I can tell, you need a business and a credit card to register a name.
  * the trademark time till the next extension is 10 years and I think it costs about 250 $
  * also apparently a lot of paperwork
  * Looks like "FURCRAFT" is available in the *United States Patent and Trademark Office*: https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4805:3zo1ja.4.1
    * at the moment it is DEAD (but there still seems to be an owner: https://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=tm&qt=sno&reel=&frame=&sno=71349853)
    * there is a useful explanation at https://brandnic.com/dead-trademark-and-how-to-claim-it/ how abandoned trademarks can be aquired
    * Apparently companies can still hold some rights on a trademark, even though it is expired.
