## Furry games list?

### Let's share our information.

Hey, every furries. This is Mn who is just new to communicate w/ other furries.

I just want to find some list of furry games.. and there are lots of curator and reddit thread on it, but actually they aren't keep updating.

So I'm trying to make my own list..

If you guys know any other games I missed, please comment it.

I know some Games that

* main 'character' or 'an outlook on the world' are totally Furry related.
* Not Nekomimi
* Not Feral
* SFW ( I like NSFW, too. but I guess it is not fit to public forum)

These are on steam...

* Armello
* Angel with Scary WIngs
* Major\Minor (Original, CE)
* Ori and the Blind Forest (Original, DE)
* Dust : An Elysian Tail
* Owlboy
* Undertale
* Lugaru
* Freedom Planet
* Overgrowth
* Dusty Revenge:Co-Op Edition
* Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken
* Ninja Cats vs Samurai Dogs
* Cavestory
* Ethan: Meteor Hunter
* Hoard
* Stories : The Path of Destinies
* Animality
* Rivals of aether
* Awesomenauts

and some games have huge furry related factions...

* The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim
* Starbound
* Wakpu
* Final Fantasy

These are out of Steam

* Klonoa Series
* Sonic the Hedgehog Series
* Starfox Series
* Solartorobo
* Tail Concerto
* Sly cooper
* Bloody Roar series
* Jazz JackRabbit 1,2
* Hidden Agenda
* Animal Crossing
* World of Warcraft (werewolf, Tauren, Panderen Factions)
* Pokemon(?)
* CheetahMan(...)

If you want just Nekomimi or Ferals,
here it is. (Nekomimi : N, Feral : F)

* Oneshot (N)
* Shelter (F)
* Shelter 2 (F)
* Paws : Shelter 2 game (F)
* Rynn's Adventure: Trouble in the Enchanted Forest (F)

I am not a huge fan of ferals. and also there's tons of games which are have animal main character. So, it is too hard to list all games.

I didn't include games only have few character which are furry.
(ex. Risk of Rain, Super Mario series, Shining Force, etc)

and sorry for lists are not an alphabetical order.

also sorry for I may spell wrong because I am not a native English user.

These are all I know.

Please share if there are any other furry games you guys know.

and NSFW games, for this topic, give me a DM :D

----Non Steam Games----

* Fur Fighters (Ok i am bit stretching since they are technically stuffed animals)
* Vivisector: Beast Inside (More like cybernitic animals both feral and bipedal and sentient but they pass for me)
* Mana series (There are quite some furry characters that are both NPCs and playable characters)
* S.W.I.N.E (A abandonware RTS with pigs VS bunnies)
* Legend of Kay (LoZ-like action platformer)
* Brutal: Paws of Fury (Fighting game for Genesis)
* Conker's Bad Fur Day (A NSFW [Swearing, alocohol, tons of violence, adult humor and more] platformer made by Rare for N64 and later Xbox 360)
* Gex series (Platformer during the early rise of 3D platformers)
* ÅŒkami (Well the titacular character is feral wolf)
* Guncaster [A GZDoom mod] (The main character is a mortal humanoid dragon that uses as the title suggest uses both guns and magic)

----Can be found on Steam----

* Bedfellows FRENZY (Based of the webcomic of the same name and can be NSFW for some due to the largely adult humor)
* Anubis and the Buried Bone (A classic style platfomer also has NSFW version, coming to Steam soon)
* Armello (A TBS game)
* Sam & Max series (Based of the comic of the same name and made by Telltale)

My list according to the games I know so far:

Steam Games:
* Nekojishi (A Furry Visual Novel game that's currently in development, and on Greenlight now.)
* Dust: An Elysian Tail (Metroidvania Beat 'Em Up)
* Major/Minor (Another Furry Visual Novel. The one I didn't really play, because I don't has it)
* Rocket Knight (I hope I got the name right. It's a classic game I think remastered into Steam)

Non-Steam Games:
* Klonoa series (Very underrated platformer. Adorable too!)
* Sonic the Hedgehog (Unlike Klonoa, speaks for itself, because almost everyone knows what a Sonic is. *insert JonTron's "what the FUCK is a Sonic" meme*)
* Starfox Series (I guess an on-rails shooter? I dunno, I haven't played Starfox :v)
* Little Tail series (Famously known so far for Solatorobo)
* Bubsy the Bobcat (Basically a video game series trying to compete with Sonic and Mario, but failed)
* Donkey Kong
* Digimon(?)

Das all I got

(Also, thank you for mentioning Klonoa :3)
