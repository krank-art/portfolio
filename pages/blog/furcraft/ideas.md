# Ideas
Created on 30th April 2022

* Animated GUI based on state in game (if player gets attacked or resources are low, tiny red lights flash up; could also be used for dramatic effect, like when the player army is chased by a scary monster, the command bar displays an alarm)
  * Inspired by Maelstrom: The Battle for Earth Begins (2007) idle animation of command bar.
* Snow fall shader
  * Inspired by [The Settlers Rise of an Empire (2007)](https://youtu.be/DWZf4c_ZlE4?t=1410)
* Simplified Sprites
  * In *My Life as a Teenage Robot (2002)*, when zoomed out character designs get drawn simplified (see Episode with Hydroflaux, when Jenny is hovering in the air)
