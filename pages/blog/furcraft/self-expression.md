# Self Expression

> **Krank,** created 13th April 2022

* The goal of this game is to please comma that it is a flexible design base for all types of RTS play
* The list of the following games is inspired by successful custom maps in Warcraft 3:
  * Tower Defense (Tropical Tower Defense, Elemental TD)
  * Building simulation (Empires II)
  * Mini games (Canned Bread, Skibi's Castle TD, Uther Party)
  * etc.

In addition to a powerful world editor, the game will also have a campaign.


## 2.5D visuals

* Optics should be similar to the StarCrafts mod for StarCraft 2 by Carbot.
  * That means the level itself is 3D
  * But the sprites themselves are 2D (flat stands)
* See also Paper Mario, how you can combine these looks well.
  * In this case it would be practical if buildings were still 3D
  * What I also like about Paper Mario is that it's nice.


## Player Customization

* In a normal battle, players can customize and change all their unit sprites and building models themselves.
  * Building models should be editable in a 3D editor like in Spore.
  * Units should consist of sprites (i.e. 2) so that changes are as accessible as possible.
    * If you use 3D-animated characters, things get complicated very quickly (modeling, rigging, animating)
    * The aim is to make it as easy as possible for every user to express themselves, so simply draw the different states.
    * Inspired by Friday Night Funkin', as it is very easy to create mods here.
    * Inspiration for a sprite editor would then be from WarioWare: DIY.
* There will be an expressive chat editor (see Team Fortress: Source 2 project announcement video)
  * This should allow emojis and be able to change different language channels (see chat window in StarCraft 2)
  * It would also be possible for users to upload their own custom emotes (like in Discord or with frankerfacez.com)
* Social is also important. Players should be able to add other players as friends and form groups (clans).
  * Theoretically you could also make a group page where groups can introduce themselves and customize the page.
