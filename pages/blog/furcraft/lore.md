# Lore

* Worldbuilding
  * World building is necessary, so the players have a creative foundation they can build of.
  * The story of the campaign can actually be quite cheesy, the more important thing is to have very good world building.


 half the world war three,  earth and its environment very different  then we know the all today.
 through massive shelling aten bombs the atomic winter  another catastrophes the terrain has changed significantly.
 there are so remnants of the past regions visible.

 but the passage of time and the natural healing of the environment after the world war  he slowly washed away the wounds and created new wildlife.
 this wildlife was affected by the higher amounts of radioactive radiation.
 the  DNA has changed they grew a lot bigger smarter and agile.

 over the very long span of time slowly anthropomorphic creatures developed.
 the radioactive Fall art has also declined to a level,  normal living on earth is possible again.
 with the more human like features of the animals they are also developed more intelligence.

 similar to the human evolution,  animals started forming promotive civilizations.
 these primitive civilizations were grouped by different species  that benefited from the coexistence.
 carnivorous mammals like walls dogs cats banded together forming the Carnis Faction.
 the mindset of the carnivores is that everyone has to fight for themselves but in order to reach a common goal,  corporation is temporarily sufficient.
 battle style focuses on raw Pawar and dominance.

Herbivores banded together in order to protect themselves from the raids of carnivals animals.
they had to quickly adapt are environment and create nachos and weapons to fight off the incoming waves.
 this led to the habeas being the early adapters of new technological discoveries.
 the civilization is more sociable and they put high value on teamwork  to reach a common goal.
 on the battlefield the herbs usually focus on technological advantage, mobility and precise attacks.

The third faction consists of the scaly creatures.
radiation and natural evolutions have led to lizards becoming very large,  some even developing wings and the ability to spew fire.
they are a more mystical civilization focused on religion, heat as the source of survival,  and the protection of eggs.
the lizards also feed on the herbivores but they don't  discern that march, they also feed on carnivores.
the military tactics focus on usage of stealth, poison  an exportation of the other parties weaknesses.


## Theme

 the theme of the universe should be about the distribution of the limited amount of resources on current earth.
 factions don't just attack  another faction because they feel like it'd come it's about surviving.
 like the carnivals need to eat meat because there is no proper alternative.
 and  the herbivores fight for the survival common because they've always been hunted down they don't want to die.
 the goal of the scales is to make the terrain and the planet more hospitable to them,  they need hot temperatures and swarms which contradict the cornfields of the herbivores.

 a blot pint could be that the carnivals capture herbivores and then bread them in animal sums to eat them later.
Not sure if you should explore this direction come up because it would make  history very heavy ( capturing sentient beings to feed them up and then to slaughter them for eating).
 there could also be some interesting messages in this, because  of the parallel of meat conservation in modern western and developing countries.

 the factions itself should have units and characters with popular species in the furry fandom:

Carnivores:
* fox
* hyena
* domestic_dog
* wolf
* otter
* bear
* cats
* tiger
* raccoon
* eagle

Herbivores:
* mouse
* rabbit
* horse
* sheep
* bird
* rat
* skunk
* deer
* goat
* opossum
* squirrel
* pig?
* monkey?

Scalies:
* dragon
* insect
* crocodilian
* kobold
* lizard
* frog
* dinosaur
* snake
* turtle
* moth


## Resources

The main theme hinges on how resources are distributed among groups of people with different interests (aka politics).
Very technical stories are often quite boring, so the story is told through the characters itself.


## Story

A very long time ago, humanity was wiped out in the biggest and final war.
Weapons   with disruptive forces higher than natural disasters wiped out entire countries.
 landscapes and terrains were altered permanently  by there combat itself and the remnants of nuclear fallout  and winter.

humanity destroyed itself completely,  not a single cell was left.
but there were survivors.
ordinary crites animals and creatures hid deep down in earth or in remote areas in the forests.
 the nuclear fallowed in the height and radiation killed many of the animals too.
 only the strongest survive that have a heightened level of radiation  perseverance.

 over the years, these advanced animals developed even further.
 the species developed the consciousness and deformed  tribes and later civilizations.
 it was a very long process,  though artefacts  from a forgotten world  held out the creature's immensely to develop new tools.

 even though the social systems progressed a lot  and gained a lot of finesse,  the underlying  laws of nature were still full in effect.
 carnivorous groups bandit together to hand down habitus and other prey animals.
 many prey animal groups were wipeout who couldn't fight for the survival.
But some developed tools and weapons to defend themselves.

 the days of barbaric tearing Are over and the discovery of  trading and communication has helped the coexistence immensely.
 but still behind the surface of diplomatic courteousness, There are still the age fears of biological differences.
 the  herbivores, in order to protect themselves and  tube better communication with the carnivores,  have developed a substitute for meat.

the carnivals faction was actually beaten by the herbals in the last war and have gotten a mandate to feed their population with artificial meat.
 doctors and researches determined the appropriate nutrients  that need to be supplied besides the artificial  proteins.
Most carnivorous animals are not well adapted to  none made diets,  and while they are mostly making due, the supplementary  die is actually harming them.
 top researchers of the herbivores are well familiar with this phenomenon, But it is wished by the higher ups and politics to keep it this way.

 after thousands of years of getting hunted down and eaten by carnivorous animals, most prey animals  actually approved of slowly starving out the herbivores.
 if there's no more meat eating creatures, then the herbivores could prosper without fear for life.
The prey animas don't one acknowledged that they're very fertile and produce offspring very fast.
 if there is no hunting animals keeping the populations in check, the Hovers would produce offspring till the environment is oversaturated.

 effective measures for Contraception have not been discovered yet,  so there's little control on how animals multiply besides the available sources of food.
 the prey animals actually annex regions of the carnivores groups  to build wheat fields and to sustain their growing population.
 there is basically actually always a shortage on food in the prey animal regions, because  these creatures require a lot more food and lot much time to process their feed.
 it has led to a lot of turmoil, The canvas animals communities were forced to resettle and leave countrysides that were ideal for wheat productions.

 it should be noted that both factions, the praia animals and the carnivorous animals,  are quiet hetero genic groups.
 the species  itself are vastly different and have different tastes in food, culture and community.
 for this reason,  the individual species tend to stick closer together,  like rodents (mice, rats) or equine (horse, deer, donkey).

the animals in this world are actually a little racist.
romantic relationships between Species that cannot produce offspring are accepted --  but  between carnivous animals and prey animals are ill-reputed.
 there is also different  political views in the general population.
Among herbivores, many species put a lot of worth into the number of offspring,  especially in morale areas and  regions were farmers historically needed lots of children to help on a farm.

 families in carnivours families  tend to have fewer offspring.
 before the last thousand years, feudalism was actually the economical system applied by the carnivores.
 they dominated to prey animals with the raw power and deep-seated fear.
 the prey animals had to work long hours, pay tribute and even Turn own their own kind,  reserve es feed for the carnivores.

 the carnivals had little interest in making life the  peasants easier.
 many were exploited ruthlessly and  the carnival was amassed  a lot of wealth.
 of course, these former aristocrats are not very thrilled  to now be over parted by a different faction.

 most kind of the carnivores were actually dominated bytes the like group of aristocrats.
 just like the pre animals, the weaker members  in the carnival society were exploited and they had to do most of the work for an increasingly rich elite.
 it was never in the interest of the can never delete to make things better, they just wanted to keep their state quo.
  their reasoning for power was  the lineage of pure blood.
 it's not surprising that they're not coping well in losing most of the power in social status in recent years.

 there are in total three campaigns that can alter the fate of the war


## Economy

All  three factions have industrialized economies.
meaning factories pray a very important role in the economy.
 a lot of the conflict actually revolves around curing resources to feed into the own factory chains.
of course these of these disciplines are present in all factions,  but they have different strengths.

the carnivorous animals focused on  ore mining, steel production,  construction, Forestry,  conventional weaponry,  coal power plants,
the prey animals have focused on Tooling, precious metals, electronics, agriculture, Nuclear power plant, Early telecommunication.
the scales have focused on chemistry, oil production, Toxic gas, geothermal power,  oil power plant, rare minerals, fishing.


## Climate

 scales live around the equator,  in had deserts in warm and damp swarms and jungles.
 they need sufficient heat and humidity to be able to survive.
Many reptiles are also cold-blooded creatures ( they need external warmth to keep going).
In colder regions they usually place durn heating elments.

For the scales come of the fact that the overall world is cooling down is quite bad.
they are most threatened by the martial temperatures in terms of survivability (and less in terms of food).

 pray animals live just about in any kind of climate,  but most of them were concentrated in the moderate areas.
 they either have a big furor many feathers though they are sufficiently protected against coldness (and too much heat).
 the main drive is that  they keep losing agricultural land  and they desperately need it to grow their crops.
Herbivores need to consume a lot more food than carnivals, because generally there is less energy density in it.
