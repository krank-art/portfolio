### Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty Campaign

* The campaign of Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty was a lot of fun, due to different mission types.
* Based on [Campain - Liquipedia - The Starcraft II Encyclopedia](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Campaign)
* See [Wings of Liberty missions | StarCraft Wiki | Fandom](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Wings_of_Liberty_missions) for a nice graph of all missions + cutscenes (cinematics)
* Mission types:
  * **commando:** leading a small squad of units through a puzzle-like level; usually a macguffin has to be destroyed or collected or the commando unit has to reach a certain area
  * **annihilation:** destroy the majority of an enemy faction
  * **escort:** protect a vulnerable unit through a hostile area; the unit can be controlled by the AI or the player
  * **survival:** survive incoming attack waves for a specific timespan
  * **macguffin:** collect one or more important items, which are usually protected with heavy enemy forces
  * **direct hit:** destroy one or more important objects, which are usually protected with heavy enemy forces; the object can either be defenseless or a mini-boss
  * **economy:** acquire a certain amount of resources; usually these resources also have to be spent to get more harvester units or units to defend the resources
  * **tech:** build a special unit, research a special tech or build a special building
  * **capture:** collect one or more important units or buildings, which will be used further in the mission
