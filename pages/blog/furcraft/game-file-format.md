# Game File Format

* Each mission that gets played should be loaded from a special custom map.
* A custom map file contains all information necessary to play a game:
  * **Meta data:** Map name, map author, map description, map version, map id, *dependencies*, map locales, map file definition version
  * **Game rules:** player count, player teams, camera bounds, resources definition
  * **Stages (?):** One or more playable stages (like going from exterior map into a building)
  * **Terrain:** Cliffs, water, elevation level, local height, ground texture, natural landmarks
  * **Preplaced units:** Player units, enemy forces, neutral units (critters, capturable buildings, rescuable units, collectable items)
  * **Doodads:** Level decoration like stones, buildings, vegetation, fire effects, monuments
  * **Destructables:** Special doodads that can be destroyed (crates, barrels, gates) or harvested (trees, gold ore patch)
  * **Terrain modifiers:** Unpassable terrain (due to path blockers), scorched earth
  * **Regions:** Areas in the map with ambient effects (rain, mist, snow), a soundscape (crickets, whooshing meadows) or trigger zone
  * **Cameras:** Cameras and camera paths for ingame cinematics
  * **Triggers:** Custom logic for map (map initialization, story triggers, cinematic control, win/lose condition, advanced unit behaviour)
  * **Unit definitions:** units and buildings definitions;
  * **Item definitions:** item definitions;
  * **Buff definitions:** buff definitions;
  * **Doodad definitions:** doodad definitions;
  * **Destructable definitions:** destructable definitions;
  * **Upgrade definitions:** upgrade definitions
  * **Tileset definitions:**
  * **Sound definitions:**
  * **Model definitions:**
  * **Texture definitions:**
  * **UI definitions:**
  * **AI definition:** 
  * **Imported files:** textures, models, sounds
  * **Strings:** All strings and text used can be saved in a special strings file for each language (i18n)
  * **Preview image:** Preview image of map (auto-generated or user-provided)
  * **Dependencies:** Other maps that can be required as dependencies to share units, triggers or doodads between maps
* The file format of a custom map should be accessible with simple tools for better debugging and modding support.
* Some programs nowadays essentially use compressed JSON to store information (e.g. Sketch with `.sketch`) or compressed XML (e.g. Word with `.docx`).
* A custom game map can also be edited and saved as an *opened archive* (uncompressed folder structure); 
  the intention is that you can save the folder structure as git repository
* File structure proposition:
  ```bash

  ```


## Dependencies

* To facilitate reusability, other maps can be included as dependency for the current map.
* The only required property in a game file is `Meta data`, every other property is optional.
* This should help map creators create reusable script libraries, unit definitions, environment packs, campaign bases, etc.
* This means there has to be a central *map package repository* and a *map package manager*.
* The loading order for each property is 1) base game (a special package), 2) package or 3) per-map.
* Tree shaking is necessary, so only actually used properties of dependencies get imported and executed
  (do we need a *map build tool* for that? I'm not sure, but we would need the difference between *dev* and *production*)


## Inspiration

### Warcraft III `.w3x` Custom Maps

* File format of `.w3m` files (map files of WarCraft III), see [unofficial `.w3m` docs](https://wc3maps.com/InsideTheW3M.html) by ZÃ©pir oo.
  * Warcraft III uses `.w3m` and `.w3x` files. (also called "scenarios for Warcraft III World Editor")
  * Essentially a MPQ file (MPQ seems to be an archive format like `.zip`).
  * File Structure inside the quasi MPQ `.w3x`: 
    ```bash
    (listfile)            # (internal file for MPG)
    (signature)           # (internal file for MPG)
    (attributes)          # (internal file for MPG)
    war3map.w3e           # environment (tileset); header: which tileset to use, data: height, ground level, texture,   
                          #   flags (like "Ramp" or "Water") for each tilepoint; a tileset is made up of 4 tilepoints, 
                          #   so a 256x256 map has 257x257 tilepoints
    war3map.w3i           # info map file; contains some info displayed when a game is started like map name, map author,
                          #   map description, player count, camera bounds, playable area of map, map flags like 
                          #   "hide minimap in preview screen", "use custom forces", "use custom abilities", etc.
    war3map.wtg           # trigger name file; includes categories, variables and triggers used for scripting
    war3map.wct           # custom text trigger file; custom trigger structures and their name, I'm not sure what it means
    war3map.wts           # trigger string data file; special trigger strings `TRIGSTR_***`, but I'm not sure what it means
    war3map.j             # JASS2 script file; controls custom behaviour of scenarios; raw text file
    war3map.shd           # shadow map file; each tile is divided into 4x4 and then has the value "shadow" or "no shadow"
    war3mapMap.blp        # minimap image; is `.blp` format (Blip, which prolly means "BLIzzard Picture"), similar to jpeg
    war3mapMap.b00        # ???
    war3mapMap.tga        # ???
    war3mapPreview.tga    # preview image; displayed when hosting the game
    war3map.mmp           # menu minimap; this is prolly the ingame minimap with player colors, gold mine icons, etc.
    war3mapPath.tga       # old path map file (used by WarCraft 3 Beta Versions <= 1.21), use `war3map.wpm` instead;
                          #   `.tga` is a raster image format, in this case 16-Bit RGBA-TGA; the tiles in the map are split
                          #   into 4x4 and then the color channels are used to apply path flags: RR (no walk), GG (no fly),
                          #   BB (no build) and AA (blight, the black stuff of the Undead)
    war3map.wpm           # path map file (supersedes `war3mapPath.tga); each tile in the map is split into 4x4 and then
                          #   multiple flags are applied per chunk: "walk/no walk", "fly/no fly", "build/no build",
                          #   "blight/no blight", "water/no water", 2 flags are unused, 1 is unknown
    war3map.doo           # doodads map file; defines position, rotation, scale, variant, flags and lifepoints for doodads 
                          #   like trees, levers and decorative elements like stones, grass, waterfall, etc; also includes 
                          #   the number of currently placed doodads (there is a hard limit in the game); doodad flags
                          #   are essentially "visible/invisible", "solid/non-solid"
    war3mapUnits.doo      # units and items file; contains definitions and positions of all placed units and items of the 
                          #   map; each unit and item is described by their position (X/Y/Z), rotation, scale(X/Y/Z),
                          #   player number, hitpoints, mana points, hero level, gold amount, etc.

    war3map.w3u           # custom units file; includes two tables: original units table (default units by Blizzard) and
                          #   user-generated units table (custom units by map designer); the other custom files prolly
                          #   follow the same pattern, the unofficial docs are hard to understand here.
