# Model Atoms idea
Created on 18th April 2022

* Let's call them atoms in the following.
* Atoms are tiny, customizable parts of a model to speed up the creation of custom doodads, building models, and everything else that might use a 3d model.
* Lets take a wheelbarrow model for example:
  * It's frame is made up of wooden beams.
  * The base of the frame is a wooden plank.
  * It has a wooden wheel.
  * The handles are branches with bark.
  * In it's frame, a big sack is placed (possibly filled with potatoes).
* Atoms itself should have adequate shape keys
  * Like a branch with bark could have the shape keys:
    * Length
    * Width
    * Crinkles
    * Bending
* Atoms should be colorable
  * E.g. a branch with bark can have different wood textures to look like pine, beech, birch, etc.
  * Texture should allow a color tint to make things like a burned birch branch.
* The intention is to make customizing and editing models for buildings, doodads and units more accessible.


## Inspiration

* Warraft 3 Doodads
  1. Open World Editor of Warcraft III: Reforged
  2. Look through all doodads model and try to determine a sensible atom
  3. Add atom as element to the most fitting category and (optionally) provide a usage example in a model.
