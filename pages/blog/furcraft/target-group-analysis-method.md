[Know Your Market: Making Indie Games That Sell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy0Dfr-mnUY)
* Do people actually want to buy this game?
* Steam
  * Filter game reviews by "Steam Purchasers" and "Other"
  * Steam Spy only tells you the "owners" of a game -- but a "owner" is not necessarily a buyer.
  * Many stats on Steam Spy get inflated by bundles or gifted games.
  * Simple Heuristic: Boxleiter Method
    * Player Count = Review Count * 50 (a rough estimate)
  * Data sources
    * store.steampowered.com
    * steamspy.com
    * isthereanydeal.com
    * steamcharts.com
    * steamdb.info
  * "Should you make a puzzle plattformer in 2018?"
    * no
  * Analyze, how much money each genre roughly makes on steam
    * Typical indie genres like "Puzzle Plattformer", "Rogue-like" and "Metroidvania" make very little money.
    * Median Revenue for "City Builder" and "FPS".
    * High revenue for "Action RPG"
  * Visuals
    * Very important for potential buyers
    * Visual Distinctiveness of the game is very important
    * Examples for games with a unique style:
      * Super Hot (clean, low poly, cool bullet traces)
      * Cuphead (30s cartoon)
      * Darkest Dungeon (dark, grunge, illustrative)
  * ESRB
    * As the age rating goes up, so does the revenue.
    * The correlation factor of rho = 0.45
    * It seems that its better to appeal to adult players, because they can actually make purchases on steam
    * "Family Friendly" is actually 23x worse than "Crime" as tag on Steam.
    * That means Steam as platform is generally really bad for family friendly games.
  * Playtime
    * Longer playtime is very important on steam
    * Maybe?? Steam gives an algorithm bonus on the storefront
    * But more important, when having Steam open and messages shows up "XYZ is playing Spelunky", it provides an incentive: "huh maybe I should also play Spelunky".
  * Streaming
    * When a Streamer plays a game, viewers can go like "huh maybe I also want to play that"
    * Short, narrative games or puzzle games are hurt by streaming, because they have consumable content.
  * Community
    * Can the community get involved?
    * Level editors
    * Mod support
    * Leaderboards
    * Estimated Median Revenue for categories:
      * 4 Player Local -- almost nothing
      * Level Editor -- almost nothing
      * Online Co-Op -- Mittelviel
      * Team-Based -- Mittelviel
      * Moddable -- Sehr viel
  * Takeaways
    * These are broad trends to consider 
    * Keep the rends for success in mind
    * Of course you can also make it, if you find a particular niche and supply it (but the niche has to be big enough to support your game)
    * Are you making something that people want?
    * Is it a fit for the marketplace?
  * Questions to ask
    * Are there recent examples of successful games in your genre?
    * Have you looked at unsuccessful games in your genre?
  * More to learn
    * Clark Tank on YouTube (Ryan Clark, creator of "Crypt of the Necro Dancer")
    * StreamProphet.com (Lars Decet?)
    * Co-Optional Podcast (they have a segment where they react to upcoming releases on steam and that can be helpful)
  * Feedback & Questions
    * Both from live audience at the time of the talk and the YouTube comments.
    * The correlations should be taken with a grain of salt. Correlation =/= Causation
    * The talk does not address market saturation in the correlations. E.g. "Puzzle Platformer" is not very popular, because there simply are so many indie puzzle platformers.
    * To get a feeling how well a newly released game on steam does, check weekly for releases and the revenue they generated on steamspy.
